## About the language

### What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using Garbage Collection.

Rust is syntactically similar to C and C++, but the big difference is that Rust is _safe by default_; all the memory accesses are checked. It is not possible to corrupt memory by accident.

Rust is a very modern language. It uses LLVM on its backend. Rust supports a mixture of imperative procedural, concurrent actor, object-oriented and pure functional styles. It also helps generic programming and meta programming, in both static and dynamic techniques.

The unifying principles behind Rust are:

- strictly enforcing _safe borrowing_ of data
- functions, methods and closures to operate on data
- tuples, structs and enums to aggregate data
- pattern matching to select and destructure data
- traits to define _behaviour_ on data

### History 

The language grew out of a personal project started in 2006 by Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare. Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009 and announced it in 2010.
